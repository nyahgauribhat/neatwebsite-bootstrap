                    <p> Wonderful service, easy online booking, clear and transparent pricing from the start. They sent
                        text
                        updates with time of arrival and finishing, about an hour after finishing I got sent a detailed
                        email with before and after pictures. My real estate could not fault the cleaning and I received
                        my
                        full bond refund 48hrs after the final inspection. Very happy with the service, could not fault!

                <p> Our rental bond cleaner called just before the agreed time to advise they would be 5mins late -
                    could NOT fault their timeliness or communication. They did an excellent and very thorough job. I
                    really appreciated the email at the end of the clean with before and after photos so I didn't have
                    to drive all the way back to my old house. Our real estate did not raise one single concern with us
                    at all and we got our bond back. Neat followed up...</p>

                    arrival but arrived right at the start of that. They did a fantastic job of cleaning and afterwards
                    sent through a before and after picture of all areas of the flat which I've never had from a

            <p> * Our Bond Back Guarantee:</p>
            <br>
            <p> 1. You are required to confirm with your real estate agent which specific cleaning services are
                required under your lease agreement. You must ensure that you tick the appropriate checkboxes on our
                cleaning checklist when booking a Clean.</p>
            <br>
            <p> 2. If, within 72 hours after your Clean, we are notified by you or your real estate agent that a part of
                our Services (as described in your Booking and in our cleaning checklist) has not been completed
                satisfactorily to allow your tenancy bond to be released back to you, we will come back to your
                Residence to re-perform those Services for no additional fee (Bond Back Guarantee). Any such
                notification should include photographs evidencing the areas that need to be addressed and we will make
                an assessment of whether the area is cleanable.</p>
            <br>
            <p> 3. Our Bond Back Guarantee does not cover the following: <br>
                (a) cleaning services not described in your Booking or cleaning checklist available on the Site;<br>
                (b) permanent damage at your Residence, including smoke stains, carpet stains, hard water stains, wall
                marks, mould, rusting, grease stains, and permanent odours; and <br>
                (c) areas which, in our professional opinion, cannot be cleaned.</p>
